Bookmarks Specification, Version 1.0
================

## Description

A bookmarks file describes spatiotemporal bookmarks. The bookmarks file usually contains the highest interest features or locations.

## Specification

A bookmarks file is generally a tab delimited TSV file.  However, it can be delimited in a variety of ways.  The delimiter is set in the properties file.

A boookmarks file can contain two types of bookmarks: location and feature.

### Location Bookmarks

Location bookmarks jump the user to a given location when triggered.  Location bookmarks can also include a zoom, too.

### Feature Bookmarks

Feature bookmarks jump the user to a given feature.  If a location and/or zoom is specified it is also respected.  The application will attempt to launch a popup if it is specified for the given layer when a bookmark is triggered.

### Columns

A bookmarks file contains the following columns: name, label, type, latitude, longitude, zoom, layer, field, and value.
