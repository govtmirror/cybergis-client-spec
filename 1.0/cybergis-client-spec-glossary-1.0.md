Glossary Specification, Version 1.0
================

## Description

A glossary file describes a glossary of terms and definition. Generally speaking, this information is not used within the map, but used elsewhere in application to help users understand vague or unknown terms.


## Specification

A glossary file is generally a tab delimited TSV file.  However, it can be delimited in a variety of ways.  The delimiter is set in the properties file.


## Examples

To load a glossary file it first must be linked to in the properties file.

### Properties File
